Extract RGB Values from PNG Files

The purpose of this project was to visualize the use of color in the many paintings Bob Ross created on the show "The Joy of Painting"

The first step in this process was to extract all of the RGB values of the pixels in an extract of the painting's png files, using Python. The second step is to group those RGB values into a smaller subset/range of colors to allow me to more easily group and distinguish unique colors. By finding the most similar RGB value in the subset, I was then able to aggregate the colors used in total and by pixel position on the canvas. 

The last step in the process was to visually select and categorize the types of paintings to see if there were similarities and patterns across different paintings in the same category (ie. mountains, ocean, sunset).
